# Taxi Fare Prediction Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for a project aimed at predicting taxi fares using historical trip and fare data. The project involves data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- jupyter (optional, for running Jupyter notebooks)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```

git clone https://github.com/NafisRayan/Data-Mining-Python

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```

cd taxi-fare-prediction

```

3. Install the required Python packages:

```

pip install pandas scikit-learn jupyter

```

### Running the Project

- To run the project, start by loading the data. The project expects two CSV files: `fare.csv` and `trips.csv`. These files should be placed in the same directory as the script or notebook.
- The main script or notebook (`main.py` or `main.ipynb`) contains the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Run this script or notebook to execute the project.

## Project Structure

- Contains the raw data files (`fare.csv` and `trips.csv`).
- Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model development.
- Will contain the trained model files.
- `main.py` or `main.ipynb`: The main script or notebook that orchestrates the data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, containing information about the project, how to set it up, and how to run it.
